## Projects
### Analysis of Flight Delays and Public Opinion at EWR Airport
- In this project, I utilized sentiment analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the reasons behind flight delays at EWR airport and to gauge public opinion on the matter. Through my analysis, I found that delays at EWR are often related to traffic management initiatives, gate delays, taxi delays, and airborne delays, which can be attributed to capacity constraints.
- This analysis underscored the importance of investing in infrastructure upgrades, increasing staffing levels, and implementing new technologies and procedures to address capacity constraints and improve operational efficiency. Overall, my project highlights the importance of monitoring and addressing delays to provide a better travel experience for passengers at EWR airport.

### User Behavior Profiling with NLP & LLM
- I utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Models (LLM) to delve into user behavior on social media platforms.
- This involved analyzing sentiments, engagement patterns, and Named Entity Recognition (NER)for a nuanced understanding. Leveraging tools like spaCy and the Hugging Face library, the project provided valuable insights crucial for strategic decision-
making.

### Bird Image Classification System using CNN and MongoDB
- Implemented a Bird Image Classification system using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MongoDB, incorporating transfer learning from VGG16 for improved model accuracy. Applied advanced data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Integrated MongoDB for efficient data management. The project resulted in a high level of accuracy in classifying various bird species, showcasing my proficiency in machine learning, computer vision, and database management.
